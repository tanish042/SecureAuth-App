# SecureAuth-App
Streamlined User Registration and Authentication Developed a dynamic user registration form application using a RESTful API, JavaScript, and the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating engine. In this project, I created secure and user-friendly web application.
# The various HTTP Methods used are:
GET: Used to retrieve data from the server. It is a safe and idempotent operation, meaning it should not modify data on the server.
POST: Used to create new data on the server. It is not idempotent and can cause the creation of multiple resources with repeated requests.
PUT: Used to update or replace an existing resource on the server. It is idempotent, meaning repeated requests have the same effect as a single request.
PATCH: Used for making partial updates to a resource in a RESTful API by providing changes to specific fields, without replacing the entire resource. It is idempotent, meaning repeated requests have the same effect as a single request.
DELETE: Used to remove a resource from the server. It is also idempotent.
